# Bike Share Data Analysis

### Overview

This project explores bike share usage patterns in three major U.S. cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC. Using data provided by Motivate, a major bike share system provider, the analysis uncovers trends and insights into bike-sharing usage across these cities. The project is implemented in Python, featuring both a command-line interface and a Streamlit-based dashboard for interactive data visualization.

### Project Structure

- **Data Files**: CSV files containing bike share data for each city.
- **Scripts**:
  - `bikeshare.py`: Python script for interactive command-line analysis.
  - `dashboard.py`: Streamlit-based dashboard for data visualization.
